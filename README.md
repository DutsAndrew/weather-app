<strong>How-to:</strong>

1. The Weather App will automatically pull a city request and display it on the page on launch. But to do your own search you simply type in the 'city' that you want the weather for, click enter, and the app will get and display that information.
2. Main weather data is displayed at the top left
3. Auxillary or extra information will be displayed at the top right
4. On the bottom you'll find a navigation bar that will allow you to toggle between the Daily or Hourly weather information for the searched city.

<strong>Thing I learned:</strong>

1. APIS - With this project I learned how to access apis with an api key and how to manipulate that returned data through JSON manipulation. It was interesting to go through and use Open Weather's API, read their documentation on how to utilize it, and then implement it based on that information into my project. APIs seemed a lot more confusing then they actually were and I'm happy with how quickly and easy it was to implement into my code. I am however, eager to learn how to use APIs from the back-end, especially when it comes to preventing the API key from getting exposed to the user or used in JS.

2. Asynchronous Code - Before building this weather app, I watched a few hours worth of YT videos on how asynchronous code works in JS, which really helped solidify how it was working in my app. Knowing and understanding that Async code was essentially put on hold while the main application runs and as there are holes the async code will run was helpful in helping my build my async code first and then the rest of the application around it. I'm interested to see what a more advanced application would look like when there are more API fetch and await requests going on.

4. Building - I was much more prepared to tackle this project then I was on my last one, the "to-do-list". This time around I didn't want to get caught up on the small little things. So, I planned the whole project out, drew it up on my iPad and then followed through on my blueprints, and now that I've successfully done that on this project; I plan to continue doing so on my other ones.

<strong>Rooms for Improvement:</strong>

1. More dynamic building - I had intended to implement an svg/background img change based on what the weather API returned, but I didn't end up finishing that portion. I know it would be easy to write into the codebase, and I intend to do it later when I come back to revise my code, but it would've been nice to write it in from the start.

2. I could have implemented at least one more API - I think I could've utilized another API to help with the point before when it comes to changing the svgs based on the weather.
